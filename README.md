# Marquee Parallax Effect

Welcome to my collection of creative developers' works. This one features infinitely scrolling text that changes direction based on scrolling. We will use SCSS for styling, Lenis Scroll for smooth scroll and GSAP for animation.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install framer-motion lenis sass
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

Now you are good to go.
